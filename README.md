# Game
A weird (untitled) game Suzy and Mary are making

## What goes in each folder?
- `game_assets`: Put any cool free game asset sets you come across (or paid, if you want to buy some) into this folder. This is meant to be a gigantic collection of a bunch of assets, we're not meant to use all of them (unless we want to)
- `Game/Assets/Images`: Put the game assets and animations that we are actually using in the game.
